# Astroclub Website
As an amateur stargazer I have had the pleasure of engaging many acquaintances and sharing experiences and events about a topic that without exaggeration could be regarded as the beginning and end of all sciences. Yet for many it remains an abstract and an obscure puzzle not at all helped by the unsociable hours and the very hard to follow text-dense websites associated with this subject. This exercise will be a small attempt to rectify the latter.

Astroclub is designed to be a first stage responsive website for an astronomy club based in  Dublin/ Ireland to rapidly illustrate the wow factor of astronomy, deliver some immediate use for first time and regular  visitors and be an entry point for club members and prospective registrants.
 
## UX
The UX process employs the 5 planes approach as follows:
### Astroclub Objectives
* (Enable a site called Astroclub) Provide site visitors and club members with a resource comprising regionally relevant information on astronomy mainly via YourSky
* (Provide callout or hero statement) Provide a small impactful showcase of what astronomy is about enabled by a carousel
* (Provide images showcase - NB: no member upload on this version) - Provide a gallery of astrophotography (images contributed by members of club)
* (Frontend Only - no data capture) Allow members to login / register to join club
* (Frontend Only - no data capture) Allow visitors to leave a message
* (Location specific link -from "ClearOutside") Give up to date information on nighttime viewing conditions
* (Static Only) - Give a monthly Astonomy related events list together with a map of the area's night sky
* (Not implemented - not feasible at this time) Provide member login and registration backend
* (Not implemented - not feasible at this time) Automate the YourSky features on Night Sky and Events - would require populating separate database 
* (Not implemented - not feasible at this time) Provide educational guides on observation and types of equipment and setups to use
* (Not implemented - not feasible at this time) Be a pointer to a selection of resources on astronomy - education, buy and sell, events and meetups etc.
* (Not implemented - not feasible at this time) Provision online tools to help members for observation
* (Not implemented - not feasible at this time) Provide database and resources for members to upload contributions, calendar of events etc
* (Not implemented - not feasible at this time) Capture locale information based on visitor IP and/or GPS to facilitate a geo context for nighttime viewing.

### Scope
Scope will be defined in terms of 3 types of user - the CLUB, the member and the visitor. This to be done in the context of those objectives that are 

* As an astronomy club I want to provide in impactful landing page to attract visitors and new members in North Co. Dublin 
* As a Visitor I want to leave a message with the club
* As a Member/ Visitor I want to access a link to give me  observation conditions in North Co Dublin
* As a Member/ Visitor a gallery of images to view latest member astrophotography contributions
* As a Member/Visitor I want to access social media to allow access to relevant clu contributions there. 
* As a Member/ Visitor I want look up a page to access the latest skymap and events for my area
* As a member I want to be able to login to Astroclub to access other functions 
* As a visitor I want to be able to register to become a member of Astroclub


### Structure
IXD/ Interaction design is for an audience of hobbiests/interested parties who need certain specific information which relates to the time of day and their location. The subject matter is astronomy and the questions being immediately addressed is why? What it like tonight in my area, what can you see? are there examples and finally, how can I become a member?

IA/ Information architecture will comprise a mix of a simple inked set of pages starting from the home and working out to a number of other facilitory pages.  It is one level deep and the information types comprise links, images, tables and forms.

The layout is HERE

In all, there will be 4 web pages.

### Skeleton
The  wireframe illustrating the home, yoursky, gallery and members pages is available HERE

The approach is use the Bootstrap Framework leverage its grid structure by dividing site pages into 3 columns (or 3 groups of 4 columns) to allow for a clean responsive design as one moves from a large screen down to mobile phone. Headers and footers will be consistent across all pages and will provide the website navigation elements as well as links to social media and ability to check viewing conditions and leave a message

### Surface

As one would expect with this subject matter, the site will be dark with many examples of deep sky and planetary images used as background or as information. The colors are primary and bright yellow with shading and borders to help the images pop out more. The aim is to keep text to a minimum.  Images shall be the main conveyor of information.

## Features

## Technologies Used

HTML 5 for main markup
CSS 3 for styling
Bootstrap 4 as a framework for styling, responsive design and some of the features
JavaScript for buttons, modal forms and styling
JQuery to support bootstrap
Font Awesome for the Icons - Social (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram), Cloud-Moon for CLear outside and Mail for leaving a message
Google Fonts for the Zen Dots font for the club brand
Balsamique for wireframing

NB: provide a link to  official sites and a short sentence of why it was used.

## Testing 

### Code Testing
There were 4 HTML files  and 1 CSS file
HTML files Index, yoursky, gallery and members.html were put through the W3C Markup Validation Service.  All errors and warnings found were cleared.
Similarly, CSS file style.css was put through the W3C CSS Validation Service and again all errors and warnings found were cleared.

### Responsiveness Testing
Used chrome browser developer tools and checked across a number of devices  Site seemed to collapse as expected as with smaller devices with no overlaps or unsightly issues with text, images or forms. Used https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com to check across a range of devices.

### Browser compatibility
Using https://try.powermapper.com/ I checked IE, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Chrome, IoS and Android. All seem to check ok.

### Google Lighthouse Ratings
The biggest issue raised are the image load times.  Images vary in size and certainly would benefit from re-engineering for resolution and level of compression.

## Credits 

### Content
I did not copy any site content knowingly.  That said, many years as an amateur astronomer I am sure I have been influenced by the style and content of many sites which number in their 100s if not thousands.

What became evident as I researched many of the sites, there were features that could be leveraged to enhance one's own site. One trivial example being
https://clearoutside.com/ which would allow one to add latitude and longitude to customise for your own area.  Other sites offer skymaps that can give all the data to display your own dynamic map on your site (knowledge of using APIs and JS needed)


### Media
Images came from screen copy or image download from the following sites

Sunspot Corona https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot
NGC6543 Catseye Nebula https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_Eye_Nebula
M31 Andromeda Galaxy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy
M27 Dumbell Nebula https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbbell_Nebula
Planet Jupiter https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter
Great Red Spot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot
NGC 869 and NGC 884 Double Cluster https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Cluster

Sky Map came from https://in-the-sky.org/skymap2.php
